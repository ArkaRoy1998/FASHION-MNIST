The task required us to do clustering for semi-
supervised learning on the fashion MNIST dataset. We have to use K-Means
clustering to identify a small subset of labelled images to seed the classifica-
tion process.We have also carried out a similar experiment for overhead MNIST
dataset.The MNIST example started with 50 clusters. Here we will be experi-
menting with different (relatively small) values of K for these two datasets.
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando’s article images—consisting of a training
set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is
a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-
MNIST serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset
for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size
and structure of training and testing splits. There are 8 classes namely T-
shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker,
Bag, Ankle boot.
